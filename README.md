# signed_bigint
The Noir repository for dealing with really large integers by Resurgence Labs. Built on top of the BigInt library by shuklaayush. 

Note: This is a highly dynamic repository. The code will change as more features are added, both at the repository level by Resurgence Labs, as well as at the language level itself by the Noir team.
